const story = [

`On 16 June 2023, it was just a normal day. I saw someone… and it felt simple, just a small thought that someone is nice.  

But on 30 November 2023, everything changed. A five-second conversation, your hair moving in the air, your expressions while smiling… and unknowingly, I got lost in your eyes.  

That day I decided to begin a new journey — not for you, but to become better for myself, so whenever I enter your life, I can bring happiness.`,

`When you were in 10th standard, every single day I used to run to the second floor first, standing near your class door just to see you. Sometimes I came near your tuition and also at the place where we met first, just to see you once.  

When you were in 11th standard, I waited till 12:30 PM daily just to see your cute face. During my lab periods, especially when you had computer lab, I came out of my class more than five times just to see you. Even in recess, many times I came near your class.`,

`Sometimes I even went back to the place where we first met. I climbed the 800 steps of Mansa Devi twice — first asking for strength to become a better person, and second praying for your success, happiness and smile. I also kept full Shravan month upvas and Friday fasts, only wishing you strength, peace and success.`,

`After two years of silent efforts, on 30 November 2025, I decided it was the right time to speak. For almost a month I waited daily at the school gate. I followed you quietly, took 3–4 rounds near your house, and whenever your hair blew in the air while driving… it was a beauty I cannot describe. Our unintentional eye contacts from your stairs were the best part of that journey. Finally, I confessed.`,

`The day I asked for just 10–15 minutes of your time, you listened. Our talk was incomplete, and I felt sad thinking maybe I wouldn’t get another chance. But the next day, you trusted me, gave your Snap ID, and without knowing much about me, you became my friend.`,

`It took me only a few minutes to understand what kind of person you are — genuine, caring, and truly beautiful not just by face but by heart. Yes, people said things about you and I decoded some wrong at first. But when I saw with my own eyes, I believed the truth. You hid things only to protect my peace. Even when I was hurt, you supported me, asked about my health, and stood there. That hard time made our friendship stronger.`,

`Life hasn’t been easy for me. But whatever happens, I have always believed that when the time comes to choose between ego and the person you care for — we should choose the person. I will always choose your happiness. Forever.`,

`Sorry Note  

Yes, I know sometimes my feelings hurt me deeply. And yes, that “yes” once mattered a lot to me. But more than anything, your smile matters. I never want to make you sad or guilty. If I ever did, I am truly sorry.  

From now, I just want to protect your smile, your peace, and always keep you as my priority. Forever.`,

`Small Surprise  

Believe me, I have never seen a girl like you. Your eyes are beautiful. Your smile is beautiful. Your expressions make me call you “expression queen.” And when your hair blows in the air… I really feel the wind is trying to tell me how lucky I am to see that moment.  

You are not just pretty — you have a soft and beautiful heart too.`
